  <h2 class='line-break'>Photo and Video Competition</h2>
  <div class="well">
    <p>
      The UK Fluids Network is launching a competition, open to all UK-based fluids researchers, for the best new photo and video in Fluid Mechanics. The competition will run every 4 months, with the first deadline 31 July 2017.
    <p>
  </div>
  <p>
  The UK Fluids Network wants to showcase new photos and videos from the UK fluids community, and is offering cash prizes of £200 for the best photo and the best video from a UK-based fluids researcher. The competition will run every 4 months and the winner will be selected by the UKFN Executive Committee from a shortlist compiled by popular vote.
  </p>
  <p>
The photo or video can be on any subject related to fluid mechanics – so not only experimental observations and numerical simulation results but also, for example, illustrations of working in a laboratory or out in the field.
  </p>
  <p>
The photos and videos will be featured on the UKFN website and YouTube channel. The winners will also have the opportunity to describe the background research in an article on the UKFN website.
  </p>
  <p><b>The closing date for entries is 31 July 2017.</b></p>
