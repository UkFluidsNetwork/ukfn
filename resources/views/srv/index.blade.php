                ECMWF is currently developing a ground breaking non-hydrostatic atmospheric dynamics Finite Volume Module (FVM)
                which will be implemented in the ECMWF’s Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). 
                The IFS is the operational tool used to provide medium range weather prediction services for the UK and most EU countries. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Many aspects of the spatial discretisation employed in the FVM originated from Dr Szmelter’s earlier 
                work on unstructured mesh models for fluid flows. In recent years, these have been substantially advanced 
                by ECMWF to take advantage of the IFS environment and High Performance Computing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main goal of the SRV is to discuss and initiate the implementation of an alternative discretisation 
                of selected operators, which could potentially offer further improvements to the module in terms of accuracy and speed.
                Suitable numerical tests will be defined and set up. Dr Szmelter will also explore whether some of the 
                advancements achieved for atmospheric flows in the FVM could be applied to other engineering and environmental flows.

            <p>
                Nematic liquid crystals (NLCs) are complex non-Newtonian fluids – anisotropic fluids with a degree of 
                long-range orientational ordering. A rapidly growing research theme concerns “nematic microfluidics” or 
                the flow of NLCs confined to thin channels. Experimentalists are keen to exploit nematic microfluidics 
                for new applications in hydrodynamics, transport phenomena and next-generation pharmaceutical applications such as drug delivery.
            </p>
            <p>
                The introduction of nanoparticles into NLCs modifies the fluid properties, and understanding this effect 
                may lead to new applications. Some earlier collaborative work between Drs Majumdar and Griffiths on the 
                flow of nanoparticles in nematic microfluidics showed interesting effects, especially in cases with multiple nanoparticles. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The SRV will therefore focus primarily on the flow of nanoparticles in nematic microfluidics, 
                and through a combination of modelling, simulation and experiments, will address issues such as: 
            <ul>
                <li>how the nanoparticles interact with the fluid flow and the nematic orientation, and vice-versa;</li>
                <li>how this interaction can be manipulated to produce desired agglomerates with desired properties;</li>
                <li>how the shape and size of nanoparticles can be varied to manipulate the rheology;</li>
                <li>assessing the predictions of different mathematical theories for nematodynamics and how they compare to experiments.</li>
            </ul>

                The SRV will initiate proof-of-concept collaborative work to develop phononic structures (Glasgow) on 
                thin-film ZnO surface acoustic wave devices (Northumbria). This has the potential of creating ultra-low-cost 
                acoustofluidics devices, capable of carrying out complex microfluidic processing of samples for applications 
                in flexible and wearable healthcare monitoring. Dr Fu will fabricate and test different designs of acoustofluidic device.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior to the SRV, suitable ZnO-coated substrate samples will be prepared at Northumbria, 
                while Glasgow will carry out calculations to confirm the microstructure geometry to be used. Then:

                    <li>
                        In the James Watt Nanofabrication Centre at Glasgow, different phononic structures (pillars or holes) 
                        will be patterned and fabricated on the ZnO-film-coated substrates
                    </li>
                    <li>The ultrasonic surface vibration patterns will be validated using a high-frequency laser Doppler vibrometer (frequency range in the 10’s of MHz)</li>
                    <li>
                        The microfluidic performance of fabricated devices will be tested using (i) conventional microfluidic test beds to look at streaming, 
                        flowing, jetting and nebulisation; and (ii) a high-frame-rate camera (up to 1MHz)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Following the SRV, the data will be used in support of new collaborative research bids, and in discussions 
                with interested industrial partners who could develop microfluidics products for healthcare applications.

            <p>
                Dr Buxton has obtained three-dimensional experimental data on the behaviour of various turbulent flows 
                (boundary layers, wakes, shear layers). With 3D data, the full velocity gradient tensor is available for 
                analysis, and we will apply various vortex identification schemes to extract flow structure information. 
                However, most of these methods are eigenvalue-based, so we will also derive complementary methods that 
                incorporate effects excluded from consideration in an eigenvalue-based approach. Hence, we will be able 
                to identify structures that are clear in both types of approach, as well as those that are better 
                represented in one than the other. We will then seek to explain these differences in terms of local 
                energy production and dissipation. Such analyses will inform the physical basis for future turbulence closures.

        <h3 class="text-danger line-break">Towards a mechanistic understanding of haematocrit changes in tumour vasculature</h3>
        
        <span class="talks-speaker display-block">Dr Miguel O. Bernabeu</span>
        <span class="display-block">Centre for Medical Informatics</span>
        <span class="display-block line-break">The University of Edinburgh</span>

        <div class="line-break-dbl-top display-block line-breakdbl">
            <p>
                Several authors have reported anomalous blood flow patterns in tumour vasculature, including deviations 
                from the typical haematocrit (red blood cell count) distributions observed in healthy tissue. 
                Such abnormalities present a challenge for drug delivery and have been linked to tumour hypoxia and angiogenesis.
            </p>
            <p>
                To date, most computational models of tumour blood flow view the blood as a homogeneous fluid and employ 
                phenomenological rules to determine haematocrit changes at vessel bifurcations. Such models fail to capture 
                the dynamics encountered in tumours. This is, in part, due to the computational challenges associated with 
                simulating haematocrit changes in a mechanistic way, i.e. using a model of interacting deformable particles 
                to describe the transport of red blood cells (RBCs) in the plasma.
            </p>
            <p>
                The SRV will initiate a collaboration between the groups of Prof Byrne and Dr Bernabeu to exploit their complementary expertise:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Prof Byrne and colleagues have considerable experience of simulating blood flow and oxygen 
                        distribution in tumours and have recently developed a microfluidics assay that recapitulates RBC dynamics in tumour vascular networks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dr Bernabeu and colleagues have recently extended HemeLB, their blood flow simulation platform 
                        that treats blood as a suspension of red blood cells 
                        (<a href="http://www.archer.ac.uk/community/eCSE/eCSE01-010/eCSE01-010.php">http://www.archer.ac.uk/community/eCSE/eCSE01-010/eCSE01-010.php)</a>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The SRV will focus on constructing and validating computational models of blood flow in realistic tumour 
                microvasculature, based on experimental data recently obtained by Prof Byrne and colleagues. These models 
                will be used to develop a mechanistic model of haematocrit changes.
