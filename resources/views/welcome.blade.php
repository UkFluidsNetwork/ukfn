    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
        Fluid mechanics underpins many established and emerging UK industries as well as critical societal issues such as climate 
        science and energy consumption. Fluid mechanics research in the UK remains world-class across several dozen institutions. 
        However, with the recent concentration of research council funding in a few universities, a network across institutions is 
        needed to ensure that academic and industrial researchers can access the widest pool of expertise and resources, and can 
        continue to innovate in critical emerging areas. The strategic mission of the UK Fluids Network is to keep the UK an
        international focal point for innovative, relevant, and impactful fluid mechanics, to engage as a group with industry, 
        and to build leadership within the community.

        Early developments in fluid mechanics research were motivated by aerodynamics and this remains an important branch of 
        the subject; Rolls-Royce, Airbus, and BAE Systems are 3 of the 6 most named partners in the Dowling review of Business-University 
        Research Collaborations. As the subject has matured, a wide range of inter-disciplinary applications have emerged within research 
        council priority areas. Examples include complex fluids and rheology, carbon capture and storage, and many aspects of the Energy 
        challenge theme and Manufacturing the Future initiative.
